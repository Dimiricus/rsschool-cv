## Job experience

Worked in an it company for 2.5 years. The company was called "ByPro". Was engaged in IT outsourcing and web development.
Developed sites mainly for CMS. I didn't write code often. This was one of the reasons for my dismissal.
Another reason is the lack of any career opportunities. Below I will list some, in my opinion, the most interesting work projects.

1. The design is the same as that of the quiz designer, but this is only a design; otherwise, it was sawed from scratch:
